## Detected Tech Stacks
- **hcc-orchestrator**: envs=[], personas=[analyst, backend, frontend]

## Persona routing

`hcc-ai-orchestrator` is the bot pickup label (`BOT_LABEL`) — every ticket the bot
works carries it. The labels below select what to *do* with a picked-up ticket, and
persona choice overrides the default tech-stack auto-detection:

1. **`hcc-scan` label (a scan-coordinator epic) → run a scan *skill*, not a persona.**
   - epic also has **`scan-aggregate`** → `/aggregate-scan`: post/refresh the
     epic-level summary from the children, then **remove the `scan-aggregate` label**
     so it does not re-aggregate on every subsequent pickup.
   - else → `/plan-scan` (additive — creates only the analysis children that do not
     exist yet, so re-picking-up an epic to widen its scope is safe).
2. **`needs-investigation` + `scan:<epic>` label → `analyst` persona (READ-ONLY).**
   Never modify a target repo, never push, never open a PR. Work via `/scan-service`.
   See below.
3. **`persona:<name>` label → that persona**, if present (explicit override).
4. **Otherwise → auto-detect by the target repo's tech stack** (Go/Python/Ruby/Java
   → `backend`; React/PatternFly → `frontend`).

Implementation tickets from a scan carry `hcc-ai-orchestrator` + `hcc-impl` +
`repo:<name>` and **no** `needs-investigation` label, so they route to
`backend`/`frontend` and flow through the normal implement→PR loop.

## Cross-service scan workflow (analysis → tickets → implementation)

A scan runs in four human-gated stages. The parallelism is in the *loop* (one
service per cycle across many cycles), not in a single cycle. Every ticket below also
carries `hcc-ai-orchestrator` (the bot pickup label).

1. **Plan** — a scan-coordinator epic (labels `hcc-ai-orchestrator` + `hcc-scan`,
   focus in its summary) is picked up → run `/plan-scan`. It resolves the target set
   from `/service-registry` and creates one read-only analysis child per service
   (`needs-investigation` + `repo:<name>` + `scan:<epic-key>`), linked to the epic.
2. **Analyze** — each analysis child is worked one-per-cycle by the `analyst`
   persona via `/scan-service`: read-only audit → per-service Jira comment (verdict +
   file:line evidence + checklist) → `memory_store` → `metadata.findings` on the task.
3. **Aggregate** — this stage is **human-triggered**: when the analyses look done, a
   human adds the **`scan-aggregate`** label to the epic and moves it back into the
   pickup queue (a `BOT_KANBAN_STATUSES` status — e.g. *To Do* — with assignee empty;
   an *In Progress* epic is not re-picked-up). On that pickup, `/aggregate-scan` rolls
   the children into an epic-level markdown table (per-service findings + common
   patterns + outliers + follow-ups) posted on the epic, reconciles against the
   registry so no target is skipped, and removes the `scan-aggregate` label. Re-add the
   label anytime to refresh the summary (e.g. after an expansion adds services).
4. **Generate implementation tickets** — ONLY after a human approves the follow-ups
   (`impl-approved` on the epic), `/generate-impl-tickets` turns them into
   `hcc-impl` tickets (core-hcc / tenant / both), linked back, which then flow through
   the normal implement loop.

Read-only enforcement for analysis: the `scan-service` skill's `allowed-tools`
exclude `Edit`/`Write`/push/PR, and the `analyst` persona forbids mutation. A
hard runtime guarantee (a PreToolUse deny-hook) is a framework-level ask — the
config-only instance cannot currently ship one (see `docs/scan-workflow.md`).
